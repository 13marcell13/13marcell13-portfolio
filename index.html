        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey! My name is Marcell. I am a 14 years old gamer, developer and student from Hungary. I have knowledge in Python, HTML, CSS, C++, C# and Lua. 
            I also used to develop Discord bots, but since the v14 update I can't use Discord.js because everything has completely changed. 
            I am currently learning Blender and LuaU scripting, so I can make games on Roblox. I also have two YouTube channels, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@13marcell13" target="_blank">13marcell13</a></li> and HunThunder. 
            I play CS2 and War Thunder the most. On the 13marcell13 channel I post CS2 videos, while on the HunThunder channel I post War Thunder videos with my closest 
            friend called √Åron. Both channels are Hungarian, since my English pronouncination is not so good. You can find my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/13marcell13" target="_blank">here</a></li>, or at the bottom of the page, where I 
            have a few projects uploaded. I also post my bigger projects on this site! Thanks for reading! Have a nice day!

            <h3>CS2 YouTube Channel</h3>
            <p>In March of 2022 I created my first YouTube channel firstly called marcell_marcell. I started the channel with Fortnite videos, but later changed to CS:GO, then CS2. The name was also later changed to 13marcell13, the username I use everywhere today. My biggest achieement on the channel was reaching 13k views on just one video. After my viral video I sadly left the channel for a year, but then came back. You can check out my channel right <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@13marcell13" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
